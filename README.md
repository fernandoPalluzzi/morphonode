# Morphonode Predictive Model (MPM)
The **Morphonode Predictive Model**, and the related **R** package `morphonode`, is the computational framework for ultrasound signatures detection and malignancy prediction in vulvar cancer. The MPM suite has two main purposes: predicting the (risk of) malignancy and the risk of single/multiple metastases, given an ultrasound profile. It provides a non-invasive diagnostic tool, highly accurate and easy to use, also in absence of experienced human examiners.

## Instal the latest development version using devtools

The latest development version can be installed through **GitHub** from any **R** environment:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Morphonodepredictivemodel/morphonode")
```

This will download the MPM source code, build the morphonode tar.gz package, and install it locally.
